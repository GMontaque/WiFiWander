## About the Project

- I created WifiWander as a platform specifically for digital nomads and remote workers who rely on finding reliable wifi while on the go. The website allows users to search for wifi spots in cities and regions worldwide, helping them locate places where they can work with uninterrupted internet access.

- The project uses React for the front-end and Django REST Framework for the back-end. The core feature of the site is a search tool that allows users to filter through continents, countries, and cities to discover all available wifi Locations. Additionally, logged-in users can contribute by adding new locations, posting reviews, and rating the quality of the wifi they’ve experienced.

- With WifiWander, I aimed to make it simple for users to:
  • Search for wifi Locations by region, country, or city through a clean, intuitive interface.
  • Filter results based on amenities, such as charging stations or quiet spaces, to find a location that meets their needs.
  • Contribute by adding wifi spots, leaving reviews, and managing their favorite locations through their personal profiles.

- I applied agile development practices, organizing the project into sprints and using user stories to guide the implementation of key features. The project is fully responsive, ensuring users can access it from any device, while maintaining strong UX and accessibility principles.

- Overall, WifiWander is designed to build a community-driven platform for remote workers, where they can discover new wifi spots, share comments, and contribute their own findings from around the world. The aim is to make finding reliable workspaces as straightforward as possible for digital nomads.
